The spaces are currently open in Whitechapel, Manchester, New York and Cape town, their aim; to provide a serendipitous environment for startup businesses to co-create, connect and scale.

My role in this project is to design and articulate the values alongside all visual representation of the Rise brand. Whether it is physical, digital, print or otherwise.
