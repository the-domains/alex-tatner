# Rise Locations

The physical location is a large part of what Rise delivers. It houses the Barclays Accelerator and provides co-working offices for entrepreneurs to run their businesses and space to run events.

The spaces are designed with the intent of the brand in mind. Giving a relaxed home office feel with subtle references to the brand throughout the space.

I am the lead designer for New York, Cape town and two other locations that are currently in progress.

I manage a team consisting of visual designers and architects while also working with suppliers and specialists.
